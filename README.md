# Big Data Management with Pyspark

This repository contains files for two projects involving big data, using pyspark for data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning development. 

# High Cost Patient Prediction
This project involves sourcing data from multiple files, cleaning data and imputing calculated values as necessary. A final dataset is compiled for use in machine learning model development. A Random Forest and a Gradient Boosted Trees model are developed for patient classification into high- and low-cost categories, using the median cost as a cutoff value. A Logistic Regression model is also developed as a baseline comparison. All models are evaluated with AUROC.

# Diabetes Project
This project demonstrates basic analysis skills with pyspark and random forest classifier development for diabetes prediction.
